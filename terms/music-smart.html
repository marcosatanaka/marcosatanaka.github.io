                        <h2 style="color: #fff">Subscriptions</h2>

                        <p>If you choose to buy a MusicSmart Premium subscription (the “Service”), payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase. The Subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the current period ends. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.</p>

                        <p>A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. The subscriptions and renewals are carried out through the App Store.</p>

                        <p>The Developer may modify or remove features of the subscription at any time, with or without notice. This may happen as a result of changes in the data providers used by the Service, or other reasons.

                        <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
