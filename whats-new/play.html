                                        <li>Play 2.0 brings the ability to follow YouTube channels and get new videos as they're released. You can save the ones you want to watch, and delete the rest. It integrates harmoniously with the existing feature set, allowing you to have a complete YouTube experience within the app - get new videos, save, organize, and watch without algorithms!</li>
                                        <li>It also adds the ability to create folders for Tags and Smart Searches, giving you more ways to catalog and organize your videos.</li>
                                        <li>These features are part of Play Premium, a subscription designed for features that extend Play's capabilities beyond saving videos for later. It brings a more sustainable business model to the app and allows me to invest in more advanced features, ensuring the app's long-term development.</li>
