                                <p class="title is-3" style="padding-top: 1em;" id="1.2.5">Version 1.2.5</p>
                                <p><em>Released Nov 13, 2023</em></p>
                                <br>
                                <p>• Added a button to open the main app when adding an item from the Share Sheet.</p>
                                <p>• The large widget now shows 16 albums when configured with the <em>Minimal UI</em> option.</p>

                                <p class="title is-3" style="padding-top: 1em;" id="1.2.4">Version 1.2.4</p>
                                <p><em>Released Sep 25, 2023</em></p>
                                <br>
                                <p>• Widgets have been reorganized to offer unified options for the Lock Screen and Home Screen. There are now three types of widgets: List, Single Item, and Add Music. I also added more sizes, specially the smaller ones, allowing for more flexible widget setups. Large and extra-large interactive widgets now have two new background colors: Black and System, which follows the system’s defaults for light and dark mode. They also offer a <em>Minimal UI</em> option that hides every UI element.</p>
                                <p>• Customizable Start Screen and Sidebar: You can now customize which sections are visible in the start screen/sidebar. Show or hide tags, smart search, a new list of actions for quickly adding music, and even new sections that automatically groups music by artist and record label. Go to <em>Settings → Start Screen</em> to configure.</p>
                                <p>• MusicBox can now optionally group items by artist and label, allowing you to easily catch up on new music from a particular creator. Artists and labels with new music will be shown in the start screen/sidebar and are sorted by the count of new music and then by name. Go to <em>Settings → Sidebar</em> to activate.</p>
                                <p>• New <em>Super Dense Grid</em> layout option that shows more music per page. If you’re on the iPad, try pairing it with a two-column layout for a more focused music list. Go to <em>Settings → Music List</em> to configure.</p>
                                <p>• Smart Search now supports filtering by multiples artists, genres, and labels when using a comma to separate the name (e.g., boygenius,oasis).</p>
                                <p>• The <em>Add to MusicBox</em> share sheet action now supports adding music manually. When adding music from an app that MusicBox can’t get the metadata automatically, the window will allow you to manually type the missing metadata.</p>
                                <p>• The music’s star rating is now present in the response of the <em>Find Music</em> shortcut action, and also available as an attribute for filtering.</p>
                                <p>• The Record Label can now be shown as a metadata option for the list and grid layout.</p>
