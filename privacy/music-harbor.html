                        <p>This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on MusicHarbor app for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.</p>
                    
                        <h2 style="color: #fff">Information we collect</h2>
                        <p>When opening the app for the first time, you can choose to authorize access to your Apple Music Account, if you have one. This will be used to recommend artists you may want to follow. Any information regarding your account is kept on the device and is not shared with anyone.</p>
                        <p>We store your Apple Music token (if you provided access) on the device, so we can use it to fetch information about your music library.</p>
                        <p>We also keep the store location you're associated with, so we can redirect you to the correct Apple Music store. None of this information is sent to any server on the internet. It is kept on your device, and is used to enhance your experience while using the app.</p>
                        <p>We may collect anonymous statistics such as how many times the app was opened.</p>
                        
                        <h2 style="color: #fff">Information usage</h2>
                        <p>The collected information is not shared with outside parties, except to the extent necessary to accomplish the app's functionality. For example, we can send your Apple Music token to Apple's Apple Music server to authenticate you.</p>
                        <p>The only information we have on our servers is the anonymous statistics we collect. Everything else is kept on your device.</p>
                        
                        <h2 style="color: #fff">Accessing, changing, or deleting your information</h2>
                        <p>As every information collected is kept on device, deleting the app will delete the collected information.</p>
                        
                        <h2 style="color: #fff">Third-party links and content</h2>
                        <p>MusicHarbor has links to Apple Music content. They have their own independent privacy policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.</p>
                        
                        <h2 style="color: #fff">Your Consent</h2>
                        <p>By using our app, you consent to our privacy policy.</p>
