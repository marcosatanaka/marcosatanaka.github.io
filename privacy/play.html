                        <h2 style="color: #fff">Information collected</h2>
                        <p>Play does not collect any personal information from you. All data you add is stored on your device, and synced to your private iCloud account.</p>
                        
                        <h2 style="color: #fff">Analytics</h2>
                        <p>Play uses TelemetryDeck for analytics. Any data sent to TelemetryDesk is anonymous, and not associated with you or your personal data. The goal is to better understand how people use the app. In other words, we don’t track specific users, only anonymized general behavior. Here's a link to <a class="underlined" href="https://telemetrydeck.com/pages/privacy-policy.html">TelemetryDeck’s own privacy policy.</a></p>
                        
                        <h2 style="color: #fff">Payment Data</h2>
                        <p>Play uses Apple as a payment provider for paid subscriptions and RevenueCat to manage trial versions and paid subscriptions. All data sent to RevenueCat is anonymised. Transactions are processed so that your payment details are never communicated to us or RevenueCat.</p>
                        
                        <h2 style="color: #fff">Accessing, changing, or deleting your information</h2>
                        <p>As all data is stored locally on your device, deleting the app will delete the data. You can also access your private iCloud account to delete any data that was synced there.</p>
                        
                        <h2 style="color: #fff">Your Consent</h2>
                        <p>By using our app, you consent to our privacy policy.</p>
