                        <h2 style="color: #fff">Information collected</h2>
                        <p>While using the app, you can choose to authorize access to your Apple Music or Spotify music library. This will be used to show the list of albums you have in your library. Any information regarding your account is kept on the device and is not shared with anyone.</p>
                        
                        <p>The app locally keeps the store location you're associated with, so it can search and find albums using the correct store. None of this information is sent to any server on the internet, it is kept on your device, and used to enhance your experience while using the app.</p>
                        
                        <h2 style="color: #fff">Information usage</h2>
                        <p>Your account information and data you enter in the app is not shared with outside parties, except to the extent necessary to accomplish the app's functionality. For example, when sending your Apple Music token to Apple's Apple Music server to authenticate you.</p>

                        <h2 style="color: #fff">Analytics</h2>
                        <p>MusicSmart uses TelemetryDeck for analytics. Any data sent to TelemetryDesk is anonymous, and not associated with you or your personal data. The goal is to better understand how people use the app. In other words, we don’t track specific users, only anonymized general behavior. Here's a link to <a class="underlined" href="https://telemetrydeck.com/pages/privacy-policy.html">TelemetryDeck’s own privacy policy.</a></p>
                        
                        <h2 style="color: #fff">Payment Data</h2>
                        <p>MusicSmart uses Apple as a payment provider for paid subscriptions and RevenueCat to manage trial versions and paid subscriptions. All data sent to RevenueCat is anonymised. Transactions are processed so that your payment details are never communicated to us or RevenueCat.</p>
                        
                        <h2 style="color: #fff">Accessing, changing, or deleting your information</h2>
                        <p>As every information collected is kept on device, deleting the app will delete the collected information.</p>
                        
                        <h2 style="color: #fff">Third-party links and content</h2>
                        <p>MusicSmart has links to third-party content like, Apple Music or music-news websites, for example. They have their own independent privacy policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.</p>
                        
                        <h2 style="color: #fff">Your Consent</h2>
