                        <p>In Settings you can choose to authorize access to your Apple Music or Spotify music library. This will be used to show the list of albums you have in your library. No personal information is collected, or uploaded to any server.</p>
                        <p>The app locally keeps the store location you're associated with, so it can search and find albums using the correct store. None of this information is sent to any server on the internet, it is kept on your device, and used to enhance your experience while using the app.</p>
                        
                        <h2 style="color: #fff">Information usage</h2>
                        <p>Your account information and data you enter in the app is not shared with outside parties, except to the extent necessary to accomplish the app's functionality. For example, when sending your Apple Music token to Apple's Apple Music server to authenticate you.</p>

                        <p>MusicSmart uses TelemetryDeck for analytics. Any data sent to TelemetryDesk is anonymous, and not associated with you or your personal data. The goal is to better understand how people use the app. In other words, we don’t track specific users, only anonymized general behavior.

                        <h2 style="color: #fff">Accessing, changing, or deleting your information</h2>
                        <p>As the only user-information stored is the music store location, and is stored locally on the user's device, deleting the app will delete this information.</p>
                        
                        <h2 style="color: #fff">Your Consent</h2>
                        <p>By using our app, you consent to our privacy policy.</p>
